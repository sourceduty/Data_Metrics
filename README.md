Data is a collection of information, facts, or figures that can be stored and processed by a computer. It encompasses everything from numbers and text to images and videos. Data metrics refer to the specific measurements or indicators used to quantify and assess various aspects of data. Analyzing data involves examining it closely to identify patterns, trends, and relationships, while sorting data entails organizing it into categories or groups based on certain criteria. Visualizing data typically involves presenting it in graphical or pictorial form, such as charts, graphs, or maps, to make it easier to understand and interpret. The process of analyzing, sorting, and visualizing data is crucial for gaining insights, making informed decisions, and solving problems across various fields and industries.
